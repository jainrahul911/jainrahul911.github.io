        <p align="JUSTIFY">Only fragmentary provings. Bears the same relation to smallpox that
        Antitoxin does to diphtheria. An extended clinical record by competent and reliable
        observers attest its curative value in variola - simple, confluent and malignant - as well
        as in varioloid and varicella. It has done splendid work in all potencies, from the 6th
        cent. to the c. m. As a preventive of, or protection against, smallpox, it is far superior
        to crude vaccination and absolutely safe from the sequenae, especially septic and tubercular
        infection. The efficacy of the potency is the stumbling block to the materialist. But is it
        more difficult to comprehend than the infectious nature of variola, measles or pertusis?
        Those who have not used, like those who have not experimentally tested the law of similars,
        are not competent witnesses. Put it to the test and publish the failures to the world.</p>
